## Exercise 2.2: Django Project Set Up

In this exercise, I learned how a Django project is structured and how it differs from a Django app. I understood that a Django project represents the entire web application, while apps are smaller, reusable modules that handle specific features such as users, recipes, or reports. This helped me understand how Django supports modular and scalable development.

I created a Django project from scratch, renamed the project directory to follow best practices, and used manage.py to run migrations and start the development server. Running migrations helped me understand how Django prepares the database before any custom models are added, and seeing the Django success page confirmed that the project was running correctly.

I also learned how Django’s built-in admin interface works by creating a superuser and logging into the admin dashboard. This showed me how Django provides powerful backend tools out of the box for managing users and data, which is very useful in real-world web applications. Overall, this exercise gave me confidence in setting up and running a Django project using professional development workflows.
