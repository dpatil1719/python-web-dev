# Exercise 1.1 — Getting Started with Python

This folder contains my deliverables for CareerFoundry’s **Python for Web Developers** specialization, **Exercise 1.1**.

## Python Version
I’m using Python **3.9.x** for this course because Python 3.8 is no longer easily available via Homebrew on macOS.

## Virtual Environments
Environments created using `virtualenvwrapper`:
- `cf-python-base` (source environment)
- `cf-python-copy` (recreated from `requirements.txt`)

## Deliverables in this Folder
- `add.py` — asks the user for 2 numbers and prints their sum
- `requirements.txt` — exported with `pip freeze`

## How to Run
Activate your environment, then:

```bash
python add.py
