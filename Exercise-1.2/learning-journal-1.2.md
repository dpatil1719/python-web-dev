# Learning Journal — Exercise 1.2: Data Types in Python

## What I learned
- Python data types: int, float, str, bool, and how to check types using type().
- Values read from a file come in as strings and need explicit conversion (e.g., float()) for math.
- Core data structures: tuples (immutable), lists (mutable, ordered), dictionaries (key/value).

## What I practiced
- Practice Tasks: file reading + type conversion, tuple slicing, list append + sort, string slicing, and building dictionaries using zip().
- Built recipe structures using dictionaries with keys: name, cooking_time, ingredients, and stored multiple recipes in a list called all_recipes.

## What I will remember for interviews
- Choose dictionaries when data needs labels/keys; choose lists for ordered collections that change.
- Strings include spaces and punctuation in indexing and slicing.
