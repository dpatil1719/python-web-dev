Exercise 1.3 – Operators & Functions in Python

Key Learnings:

1. Scripts vs Shell
Scripts allow reusable execution and avoid variable persistence issues found in interactive shells.

2. Functions
Functions help organize logic, collect user input, and return values that can be reused in the program.

3. Loops
For loops with range() are used when the number of iterations is known in advance.
Nested loops are useful when working with structured data like dictionaries containing lists.

4. Control Flow
if-elif-else statements help classify data and control program flow using conditions.

5. Data Structures
Dictionaries store structured data using key-value pairs.
Lists store collections that can grow dynamically.

6. Difficulty Logic
Business logic such as difficulty levels should be calculated dynamically instead of being stored.

This exercise helped me think logically and structure a Python program step by step.
